# Narrative Techniques

## What Is This Skill?

> The tools a writer uses to control how a story is told — how information is revealed, how the narrator relates to the reader, and how time and perspective are manipulated to create meaning.

## Why It Matters

> Choice of narrative technique shapes everything: reader trust, dramatic tension, emotional distance, and how surprises land. The wrong technique for a story can undermine even good prose and plotting.

## Key Techniques

### Unreliable Narration

### Dramatic Irony

### Free Indirect Discourse

Definitely want to learn how to use this one well.

Narrator has no agenda, or bias. The character is doing all of the work for interpreting the world, which is where the bias and assumptions will come from. The narrator, however, is an unbiased 3rd person perspective following the POV character.

### Retrospective Reframe

### Twist

I'll learn about this, but don't intend to make use of it, as I feel like it would cheapen any plot.
