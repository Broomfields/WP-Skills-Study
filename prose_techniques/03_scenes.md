# Scenes

## What Is This Skill?

> A clear, concise definition of this writing skill or technique.

### Scene Breaks

 Scene breaks can be used in a multitude of ways and for different purposes. For example, you could have a scene break which denotes a point of view change. This could be changing from one character's point of view to another character's point of view within the same sort of setting. But you could also have a major scene break which would denote the difference between a framing text and then sort of another scene, another setting. In terms of framing text, think of, say, like an epigraph or quotes or maybe a conversation with some other character elsewhere. You can also have another scene break to show not necessarily a change in perspective, although you can have that, but also just to demonstrate that time has passed, for example, morning to evening.
