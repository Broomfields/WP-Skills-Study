# Framing Devices

## What Are Framing Devices?

Framing devices are the tools a writer uses to shape the context in which a story is received. They operate at the edges of a narrative rather than within scenes, working around the story, between its parts, or woven through it at a thematic level. They signal to the reader what kind of story this is, who is telling it and why, and what perspective to hold when reading it.

There are four broad categories, which can overlap and be used in combination.

## Why They Matter

Framing creates meaning through context. Two identical stories told with different frames can feel like completely different works. A story told by a character who survived it reads differently to one told by an omniscient narrator. A book that opens with an epigraph arrives differently to one that opens cold. Framing shapes reader trust, expectation, and emotional distance before a single scene has been read, and continues shaping them throughout.

Without intentional framing, these effects still exist. They just haven't been made to work for the story.

## The Devices

### Formal Framing

Formal framing refers to the para-textual and visual elements that surround or punctuate the text. These exist outside the narrative proper but shape how it is approached and understood.

- **Title Page, Quotes, or an Epigraph** — A short quote or verse placed before the main text, usually attributed to a real or fictional source. Sets tone, theme, or context before the story begins. *eg: The Name of the Wind uses epigraphs to build dramatic irony about Kvothe's legend before showing who he actually is.*

- **Document *(Log, Diary, Passage)* Entry/Quote** — Presenting content as an extracted record. Implies a world beyond the immediate narrative and creates a sense of authenticity or found-document distance. *eg: Dracula is structured almost entirely as journals, letters, and news clippings.*

- **Illustrations *(Maps, Images, etc)*** — Visual elements embedded in the text that add context or world-building without prose. *eg: Tolkien's maps of Middle-earth make the world feel real and traversable before the story begins.*

- **Dedications & Author's Notes** — Text addressed directly to the reader or a specific person, stepping outside the narrative entirely. Author's notes can frame the work's real-world origin or intent.

- **Footnotes & Marginalia** — Notes appended to the text, either by the narrator, a fictional editor, or a fictional scholar. Can add depth, create unreliable commentary, or suggest the text is a document being annotated. *eg: Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell uses extensive footnotes to build an alternative history of English magic alongside the main story.*

- **Headers & Section Breaks** — Titles, dates, locations, or dividers that separate portions of text. They orient the reader and can carry thematic weight when chosen carefully. *eg: Chapter headers that are character names frame each section as a specific POV.*

- **Glossary & Appendix** — Reference material placed outside the main narrative, giving the world depth without interrupting the story's flow. *eg: Tolkien's appendices in Return of the King contain histories and linguistic systems that frame the story as one event in a much larger world.*

- **Chapter Titles** — When chapter headings do more than label, functioning as ironic commentary, foreshadowing, or thematic signals. They sit somewhere between formal and structural framing.

### Narrative Framing

Narrative framing is when there is a voice *(POV)* telling a story. The story is biased, and therefore the character's perspective can affect what the reader receives.

- **Prologues & Epilogues *(If using a character POV)*** — A scene recounted or presented by a character rather than the author. The character's perspective shapes what is shown and how.
	- eg: scene recounted/presented by a character.

- **Frame Narrative** — A story presented within another story, where an outer narrative provides the context or reason for why we're hearing the inner one. The outer narrator's presence colours everything the inner story tells us. *eg: One Thousand and One Nights, where Scheherazade telling stories to survive frames every tale inside it.*

- **Direct Address** — The narrator speaks to the reader as "you," pulling them into the narrative as a participant or witness. Creates intimacy and can make the reader feel implicated in what happens. *eg: The Book Thief has Death narrate directly to the reader, creating an unusual intimacy around loss.*

- **Unreliable Narrators** — See also [[01_narrative_techniques]]. A narrator whose account cannot be fully trusted, whether through bias, self-deception, limited knowledge, or dishonesty. The gap between what they say and what is actually true is where the meaning lives.

- **Internal Monologue** — The narrator gives access to a character's unfiltered thoughts, framing events through that character's mental state, assumptions, and preoccupations. Everything is filtered before it reaches the reader.

- **Epistolary Framing** — The story is told through letters, emails, diary entries, or other documents written by characters. Each document is partial and shaped by its writer's intent and their relationship to the recipient. *eg: Frankenstein frames its central story through nested letters, adding layers of distance and unreliability.*

- **Message to a Specific Character** — The narrator addresses not the general reader but a specific person within or adjacent to the story's world. Everything said is shaped by who the implied audience is.

- **Second-Person Narration** — The reader is addressed as "you" and cast as the protagonist. Creates immediacy and implication, though it can push readers away who resist the imposed role. *eg: Bright Lights, Big City by Jay McInerney sustains this through an entire novel.*

- **Retrospective Narration** — We know from the outset that the narrator survived whatever they're recounting. This frames all danger and tension differently, because the ending is implied from the first page. *eg: The opening of Moby Dick signals from the start that Ishmael lived.*

### Structural Framing

Structural framing refers to choices about the architecture of the narrative: how it is divided, in what order events are presented, and what sits outside the main flow of the story.

- **Prologues & Epilogues *(If using an omniscient POV)*** — A scene recounted by the author/narrator rather than a character. These establish or close out the world's context from outside any single character's experience.
	- eg: scene recounted/presented by author.

- **Nested Story** — A story that contains another story within it, where the relationship between the levels of narrative creates meaning. Different from frame narrative in that the nesting can go multiple layers deep.

- **Frame Narrative at a Structural Level** — Between chapters, scenes, or arcs the story returns to a narrator recounting the main story being told. The frame becomes a recurring structural beat rather than just a setup.

- **Part Divisions** — Dividing a work into named or numbered parts creates a structural rhythm and signals that something significant shifts between them. Part titles can function as mini-epigraphs.

- **In Medias Res** — Beginning mid-action and looping back. The opening scene frames everything that follows as backstory, giving the reader a destination before they know the route. *eg: The Iliad opens in the middle of the Trojan War, not at its beginning.*

- **Non-linear Structure** — Presenting events out of chronological order so that the sequence itself creates meaning through juxtaposition. The structure frames how the reader understands causality and character. *eg: Slaughterhouse-Five's fragmented timeline frames the trauma at its centre.*

- **Interlude/Interstitial Chapters** — Chapters or sections that sit outside the main narrative thread, offering a different perspective, a moment of reflection, or context. They frame the main story by stepping away from it briefly.

### Thematic Framing

Thematic framing works through repetition, contrast, and symbolic resonance across the whole work. These devices don't announce themselves structurally but accumulate meaning over the course of reading.

- **Opening & Closing Images/Symbols** — A visual or symbolic element that appears at both the start and end of a work. The closing image recontextualises the opening one, giving a sense of closure or of changed meaning.

- **Recurring Motifs/Objects** — An image, object, or phrase that returns across the work, accumulating meaning with each repetition. *eg: The green light in The Great Gatsby is present throughout but means something different by the end.*

- **Questions Posed That the Narrative Forms Around** — A central question established early that the story is built to answer, even if the answer turns out to be complicated or absent.

- **Emotional/Thematic Mirrors** — Characters, scenes, or moments that reflect each other across the work, creating patterns of comparison and contrast that carry thematic weight.

- **Cyclical Patterns** — The story ends where it began, or a situation recurs with altered meaning. The repetition itself is the point, suggesting certain things are inescapable or inevitable.

- **Contrasting Opening/Closing Tones** — Beginning in one emotional register and ending in a markedly different one, with the gap between them being where the story's meaning lives.

- **Nature/Seasonal Imagery** — Using the natural world or seasons as a thematic frame, marking emotional shifts through environmental changes. *eg: Wuthering Heights uses the moorland as a frame for wildness and constraint throughout.*

- **Subtle Building Foreshadowing** — Details planted early that only reveal their significance later, so that rereading transforms the opening. A thematic frame that rewards close attention.

- **Refrain** — A repeated phrase, sentence, or passage that recurs across the work, gaining or shifting meaning with each appearance. Used sparingly in prose it can be very powerful. *eg: "So it goes" in Slaughterhouse-Five becomes a refrain that accumulates weight with every death.*
